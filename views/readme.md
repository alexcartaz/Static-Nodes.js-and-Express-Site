Style customization:
-added background colors to social buttson (LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter)
-added rounded corners to all btn-link btns
-changed the display of my profile image to become a circle rather than a square via border radius
-added a favicon (logo) to website
-added animated GIFs to custom error message pages (did not style custom error pages; if I ever make this live I will)
