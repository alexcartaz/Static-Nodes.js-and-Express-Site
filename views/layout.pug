          p I'm a management consultant turned entreprenuer who co-founded the first social podcast app on the iPhone. 
          p My professional journey to solve podcast discovery culminated in the head of product at pre-Elon Twitter meeting with me and starting the hiring process to make me lead of a not-yet-formed podcast discovery team.
          p But a few weeks later Covid hit, they tabled their interest in podcasts, then later repurposed that interest into live audio, and then Elon bought Twitter.
          p Now I'm eagerly doing a professional pivot away from the podcasts domain, to the much more stable vocation of professional software developer.
